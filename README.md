# frontend 3.0
_Frontend Auth system to consume external API_

_Project Description_:
This project was built on a simple premise, a need I saw to build something nobody had a good tutorial on.

Instead of building your api and frontend all in one, the API gets decoupled into it's own server.
The API is able to accept requests from specific apps or mobile apps.

To login, use the following credentials:

username: admin
pass: admin

or

username: noadmin
pass: noadmin


## Update
Ported chat example from Nuxt.js examples and got it working with the app
